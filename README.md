# cropmapping_open_datacube

## Introduction:
This repository is about crop mapping workflow for both numeric data using open datacube satellite data and image data extracted from xarray datasets.
* The workflow for the Numeric models and vision models is detailed in this repository.
* The workflow of mapping visualizations is detailed i the predictions to map notebook.
* The models are stored in pickle files in the model folder.

##  Mapping preview:

## Crop mapping To add :
* Data extraction with STAC (accessing data in local or remote instance)

* Feature layers modification (choosing the optimal features for annual, in season models and changing the feature layers script)

* Large image(zone) predictions to map (handling large zones mapping)

* Adding the streamlit app (The streamlit app code and preview is ready, it will be added very soon to this repository)

## Others to add :
* Exploring drought indices and water scarcity indices extraction and forecasting
